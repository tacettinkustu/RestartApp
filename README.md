### Overview

In this mini project, we explored advanced app design concepts using SwiftUI. Our main goal was to demonstrate what could be accomplished with this powerful framework. We dived into complex SwiftUI gestures and created a custom button with unique and intricate interactions that went beyond what was available in Apple's stock user interface library. Additionally, we incorporated the parallax effect to add depth and visual appeal to an engaging onboarding screen.

### Features

- Custom Button with Complex Gestures: We designed and implemented a custom button that showcased the versatility of SwiftUI gestures. We went beyond the standard tap gesture, creating a button that responded to multiple gestures, allowing for a rich and interactive user experience.

- Parallax Effect: We leveraged the parallax effect, a technique that involved creating the illusion of depth by moving elements in opposite directions. Through the implementation of multiple movements, we added a sense of immersion to our onboarding screen, making it visually captivating and engaging for users.
